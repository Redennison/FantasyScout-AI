E.g. Prompt:
I have 2 quarterbacks. Jayden Daniels and Lamar Jackson. Who should I start?

E.g. Response:
Based on the information provided, Lamar Jackson is the stronger choice for Week 5. Here's why, based on sentiment and context:

Lamar Jackson's Consistency & Elite Status: Jackson consistently delivers both passing and rushing yards, which makes him a high-floor, high-ceiling option. With at least 45 rushing yards per game and a multi-touchdown performance in Week 4, his ability to produce points through both passing and rushing is highly valuable. The matchup against the Bengals suggests a potential for high scoring, favoring Jackson's play style.

Jayden Daniels' Solid Performance but Tough Matchup: While Jayden Daniels has shown accuracy and dual-threat capabilities, his Week 5 matchup against the Browns could be challenging. Cleveland’s defense is solid and allows only 299 scrimmage yards per game, indicating a tougher environment for Daniels to produce big numbers.

Sentiment Points to Jackson's Upside: The language describing Jackson is more enthusiastic about his "elite" potential and strong likelihood of contributing significantly to a high-scoring game. While Daniels has shown promise, the Browns’ defense might limit his upside.

In conclusion, start Lamar Jackson for his elite consistency, favorable matchup, and the positive outlook for Week 5.
