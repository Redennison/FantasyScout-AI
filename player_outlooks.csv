name,team,position,week,outlook
Jayden Daniels,Commanders,QB,6,"Jayden Daniels continues to shine as a rookie for the Commanders. Daniels threw for 238 yards and rushed for 82 more yards in Sunday's win over the Browns. Daniels has four touchdown passes in his last three contests. Daniels has passed for at least 225 yards in four-straight outings. In Week 6, he will face a Ravens defense that has been destroyed through the air. Baltimore is allowing an average of 280.2 passing yards per tilt, which is 31st in the NFL. In addition, the Ravens have allowed nine throwing scores, which is tied for 25th in the NFL. Last game, the Ravens surrendered 392 passing yards and five touchdowns through the air to Cincy quarterback Joe Burrow."
Lamar Jackson,Ravens,QB,6,"Lamar Jackson showed off his playmaking ability throughout Baltimore's Week 5 shootout win over the Bengals, as he he topped 400 total yards and delivered four total touchdowns. The game script could be similar in a Week 6 matchup against the Commanders, who have allowed multiple touchdowns to three of the five starting quarterbacks they've faced this season. Even if Jackson is slowed through the air, he has at least 50 rushing yards in all but one matchup this season. Start him confidently as an elite option at quarterback."
Kirk Cousins,Falcons,QB,6,Kirk Cousins is coming off a franchise-record 509 passing yards and faces a Panthers defense in Week 6 that allows the seventh-most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks. But Cousins attempted 58 passes in Atlanta's Week 5 overtime win against the Buccaneers and likely won't get that kind of volume against the Panthers -- opponents average 34 attempts vs. Carolina -- and his four TD passes equaled his total from his first four games. He also threw his fifth interception of the season. Cousins is more likely to have a typically modest day against Carolina rather than lighting up the scoreboard again.
Jalen Hurts,Eagles,QB,6,"Jalen Hurts has struggled through Philadelphia's first four games, throwing as many touchdowns as interceptions (4). Of course, Hurts has been without his top two wideouts for some of that time period, as both A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith have been nursing injuries. It remains to be seen if either or both of those playmakers will be activated following the bye for the Eagles, and Hurts will face a fairly stingy Browns pass defense in Week 6. Cleveland is allowing just 184.4 passing yards per outing, which is eighth in the league."
Justin Fields,Steelers,QB,6,"Justin Fields had both positives and negatives to take away from Pittsburgh's Week 5 loss to the Cowboys, as he attempted only 27 passes while averaging just 4.9 yards per attempt. On the other hand, he tallied multiple touchdowns for the third straight week after combining to record just one score across the first two games of the season. That's a reasonable encapsulation of the Steelers' offense, a unit that prefers to be conservative and is often inefficient yet sometimes Fields' playmaking ability shines through. Heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Raiders, there is a risk that those factors hold back Fields' performance, but he has produced enough to be considered a low-end starter and a premier streaming option in most formats."
Brock Purdy,49ers,QB,6,"Brock Purdy completed 19 of his 35 passing attempts for 244 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions against the Cardinals last weekend. Purdy and the 49ers will look to bounce back after this disappointing performance in a Week 6 road trip to Seattle. So far this season, Purdy has thrown for 275 yards per game, 5th most in the league. He continues to be efficient with his attempts, as well, and his 8.8 yards per passing attempt is best in the league. The Seahawks have a solid passing defense, allowing 183 yards per game in 2024, seventh overall in the league."
Joe Burrow,Bengals,QB,6,"Joe Burrow delivered an electric five-touchdown performance in Cincinnati's Week 5 loss to the Ravens, also turning in his second 300-yard passing effort of the season. With both Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins back at full strength, Burrow has led a potent offense by completing at least three passes of 20 yards in each of his last three games. Burrow now heads into a Week 6 matchup against a Giants' defense that has surprisingly been a mediocre unit, entrenching Burrow as a no-brainer fantasy option."
Dak Prescott,Cowboys,QB,6,"Dak Prescott has thrown for at least 350 yards and two touchdowns in two of the last three games for the Cowboys. Dak has six touchdown passes overall during that span. He will look to continue this hot streak in Week 6 versus a Lions defense that has been surprisingly suspect against the pass so far in 2024. Detroit is allowing 258.3 passing yards per tilt this season, which is 27th in the league. However, Detroit has only allowed four passing touchdowns through four contests, which is tied for seventh in the NFL."
Daniel Jones,Giants,QB,6,"Daniel Jones was missing his top two weapons on offense this past Sunday, but still managed to pick apart an excellent defense en route to a win for the New York Giants. Jones threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns against a Seattle defense that had allowed just four passing touchdowns through the first four games of the season prior to this contest. Jones was missing rookie sensation Malik Nabers as well as top running back Devin Singletary, but still managed to toss multiple touchdown passes for the third time in four games. In Week 6, Jones will face a Bengals defense that has yielded 10 passing touchdowns already in 2024, which is tied for 28th in the NFL."
Josh Allen,Bills,QB,6,"Josh Allen hasn't provided QB1 numbers through the first five weeks, and he'll be challenged in Week 6 by a tough Jets pass defense. Allen completed just 9-of-30 passes in Week 5, finishing his third game with 180 yards or fewer while delivering no more than one scoring strike. Week 6 brings a date with the Jets defense allowing just two touchdown passes this year, and only 161.2 passing yards per game. Allen remains a fixture in fantasy lineups but temper expectations for the Bills signal caller."
Jordan Love,Packers,QB,6,"Jordan Love and the Packers' offense will look to shake off some rust against the Cardinals in Week 6. In each of his two appearances since returning from an MCL sprain, Love has logged unsteady first halfs, including a pick-six thrown in the endzone to close out the second quarter of Green Bay's narrow Week 5 win over the Rams. With five interceptions in three games this season, Love is operating at a more mistake-prone level than is sustainable, but that can be at least partially explained by the unique circumstances of the Packers' start to 2024. Despite suffering a serious knee injury Week 1 in Brazil, Love has managed to steer Green Bay's offense into scoring position consistently. He'll look to fall into a better rhythm at home versus Arizona."
Geno Smith,Seahawks,QB,6,"Geno Smith completed 28 of 40 passing attempts for 284 yards and a touchdown last weekend. He added four rushing attempts for 72 yards, though he was sacked seven times. Seattle's passing attack has been prolific in 2024, and Smith leads the league with 39.8 passing attempts and 293.3 passing yards per game. Smith is a solid fantasy option moving forward so long as Seattle continues to throw the ball at such a high rate. In Week 6, Seattle has a divisional matchup against the 49ers. San Francisco's defense has allowed 197 passing yards per game this season, 12th best in the league."
Kyler Murray,Cardinals,QB,6,"Kyler Murray completed 19 of 30 passing attempts last weekend, throwing for 195 yards and one touchdown. Murray's best work came on the ground, and his 50 yard touchdown run headlined a day where he rushed seven times for 83 total yards. Murray's scrambling ability is a welcome boost to his fantasy floor, and his 247 rushing yards this season ranks third among quarterbacks in 2024. In Week 6, Murray figures to be a strong fantasy option as the Cardinals face off against the Packers. Green Bay has allowed 232 passing yards per game this season, ranking 23rd in the league."
C.J. Stroud,Texans,QB,6,"C.J. Stroud combined to throw for 676 yards in Weeks 4 and 5, but he could be without top target Nico Collins (hamstring) for the Texans' Week 6 trip to New England. Collins leads the NFL with 567 receiving yards, but Stroud still has enough playmakers at his disposal to be effective against a Patriots secondary that has allowed over 250 passing yards per game but only a 4:2 TD:INT. Houston is heavily favored and could lean more on the running game while playing with the lead, especially if starting RB Joe Mixon (ankle) returns, but Stroud's fantasy managers can safely deploy him as they usually would."
Baker Mayfield,Buccaneers,QB,6,"Baker Mayfield completed 19 of 24 passing attempts for 180 yards and three touchdowns in Week 5. Mayfield added an additional 42 rushing yards on 6 carries. Mayfield has been very efficient this season, throwing for 11 touchdowns and just two interceptions through his first five starts. In Week 6, Tampa Bay faces off against the Saints. This is a solid matchup for Mayfield, as New Orleans have allowed 234 passing yards per game in 2024, ranking 24th in the league."
Saquon Barkley,Eagles,RB,6,"Saquon Barkley has gone over 100 scrimmage yards in every game thus far this season for the Eagles. Barkley is averaging six yards per rush and over seven yards per reception in 2024. Without the services of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, the Philadelphia offense has had to lean even more heavily on Barkley. Even if those playmakers return in Week 6 versus the Browns, Barkley should still garner double-digit touches easily. Cleveland's run defense has also been rather suspect in 2024. The Browns are allowing 141.6 rushing yards per tilt, which is 25th in the league. In addition, Cleveland has yielded eight rushing scores, which is tied for 28th in the NFL."
Derrick Henry,Ravens,RB,6,"Derrick Henry recorded his fewest touches (16) since Week 1 in Baltimore's Week 5 wins over the Bengals, though he still provided a key 51-yard gain to seal the team's victory in overtime. In addition to his locked-in workload, Henry also has at least one touchdown in every game this season. That gives him among the safest floors at the position heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Commanders, who have allowed a league-high 5.28 yards per attempt to opposing running backs."
Trevor Lawrence,Jaguars,QB,6,"Trevor Lawrence ended a nine-game losing streak on his 25th birthday in Jacksonville's Week 5 win over the Colts, throwing for 371 yards after averaging only 182.3 in the previous four games. He'll try to carry the momentum into a Week 6 London matchup against a Bears team led by Caleb Williams, whom Chicago drafted first overall in 2024, three years after Lawrence went first overall to Jacksonville. The stout Bears secondary has held QBs to a 2:6 TD:INT, so Lawrence isn't a recommended Week 6 fantasy play, but QB-needy managers should consider stashing him on the bench in case his strong Week 5 play was an indication of Lawrence turning the corner."
Alvin Kamara,Saints,RB,6,"Alvin Kamara struggled in Week 5, rushing 11 times for just 26 yards. It was Kamara's worst rushing performance of the season, but he managed to be productive as a receiver, catching six of his eight targets for 40 yards. Kamara has dominated the backfield touches in the Saints' offense the past three games, and his near 20-percent target share is very strong. He remains a strong fantasy option moving forward as New Orleans faces off against the Buccaneers in Week 6. Tampa Bay has allowed 120 rushing yards per game, ranking 16th in the league. The Buccaneers have allowed 4.9 yards per rushing attempt, 6th most in the league."
Caleb Williams,Bears,QB,6,"Caleb Williams and the Bears will look to keep up their momentum against the Jaguars in London in Week 6. The rookie No. 1 overall pick put forth the best game of his young career during Chicago's 36-10 win over the Panthers, even if he technically compiled greater passing yards Week 3 versus the Colts. Against Carolina, Williams completed 20 of 29 passes for 304 yards and two touchdowns, becoming the first Bears signal-caller since the 1966 AFL-NFL merger to log multiple 300-yard games as a rookie. He added five rushes for 34 yards against the Panthers and also had a one-yard touchdown run nullified by. In addition to flashing real playmaking ability, Williams looked poised and consistent in Week 5, avoiding the types of mental errors that held him back early in the season. Chicago's matchup against the Jaguars in London will provide Williams a nice opportunity to keep his momentum up."
Aaron Rodgers,Jets,QB,6,"Aaron Rodgers increased his passing attempts in every Jets game, throwing 96 total times in Weeks 4 and 5. It's yielded two touchdowns in three of his last four outings, but Rodgers also has topped 244 yards just once. He's dealing with an ankle injury and faces a Bills defense in Week 6 that's allowing a stingy 215.0 yards per game, leaving Rodgers to deep league streaming."
Bo Nix,Broncos,QB,6,"Bo Nix's development curve continues to accelerate, as he threw multiple touchdowns passes for the first time in Week 5 to lead the Broncos to a win over the Raiders. The 12th overall pick in the 2024 Draft has led his team to three straight wins, completing 63.6% of his passes without committing a turnover. Nix still isn't stretching the field much as he didn't have a completion of 20 yards or longer against Las Vegas. He'll look to keep the Broncos rolling in Week 6 as a bye week streamer against a Chargers defense yielding a 72.5% completion rate, 31st in the league, but which ranks 10th with 188.5 passing yards per game allowed."
Bijan Robinson,Falcons,RB,6,"Bijan Robinson heads to Carolina in Week 6 looking for a bigger share of the workload against the league's most generous defense to running backs. Robinson had only 12 rushes in Week 5 as Kirk Cousins had 62 dropbacks in Atlanta's overtime win against the Buccaneers. Robinson likely will be more involved this week, if for no other reason than game script -- a fourth-quarter lead likely will give Robinson more carries as the Falcons look to burn clock. Robinson should also have more success against a weak Panthers run defense, which has allowed a league-leading nine rushing touchdowns to running backs this year."
Jared Goff,Lions,QB,6,"Jared Goff and the Lions, fresh off a bye, will look to stay hot against the Cowboys in Week 6. When last on the field, Goff set an NFL record in a Monday night win over Seattle, when he completed 18 of 18 pass attempts for 292 yards with two touchdowns, without an interception. Goff became the first QB in NFL history to finish with a perfect completion percentage on more than 10 attempts and with over 200 passing yards, and that's discounting the fact that he caught a seven-yard touchdown pass on his only target. Detroit's passing game had gotten off to a slow start, but Goff's immaculate Week 4 performance could be a real sign of better things to come, especially if OC Ben Johnson can hone in on some scheme adjustments during the bye. Goff is coming off back-to-back games with two passing touchdowns, and he'll get the benefit of facing a Cowboys defense that will be without DeMarcus Lawrence, and likely also Micah Parsons."
D'Andre Swift,Bears,RB,6,"D'Andre Swift and the Bears will travel to London in Week 6, with a chance to keep their momentum up against the Jaguars. After a miserable start to the year, Swift has now piled up 285 yards from scrimmage in his last two appearances. He rushed 21 times for 73 yards and a touchdown during Chicago's 36-10 win over the Panthers, while also securing both targets for another 47 yards through the air. Swift could've had an even bigger game against Carolina, as he had a one-yard touchdown run nullified by penalty in the second quarter, only to then have Roschon Johnson score on the same drive. A favorable matchup against Jacksonville puts Swift in good position to keep up his momentum overseas."
Joe Mixon,Texans,RB,6,"Joe Mixon hasn't played since Week 2 due to an ankle injury, but he has a chance to return for what would be a juicy Week 6 matchup against a Patriots defense that has allowed 137.2 scrimmage yards per game and five rushing TDs to RBs. The Texans have gone with a mix of Cam Akers and Dare Ogunbowale during the absences of Mixon and Dameon Pierce (hamstring), but Mixon should return to a workhorse role once healthy considering he handled 30 carries in his Houston debut. He'll be a fantasy RB1 if cleared to return, while no other Houston RB has proven capable of producing better than low-end RB2 numbers in Mixon's absence thus far."
Kenneth Walker III,Seahawks,RB,6,"Kenneth Walker only received five carries over the weekend for 19 rushing yards. Seattle only had 11 carries as a team, but Walker made up for the lack of rushing work with seven receptions off of eight targets for 57 yards. Walker continued to play the majority of Seattle's snaps ahead of Zach Charbonnet. It's promising to see Seattle committed to getting Walker the ball in both the rushing and receiving game, as well. In Week 6, Walker and the Seahawks face off against the 49ers. San Francisco's run defense has allowed 111 rushing yards per game in 2024, ninth best in the league."
Joe Flacco,Colts,QB,6,"Joe Flacco threw for 527 yards and a 5:0 TD:INT while filling in for Anthony Richardson (oblique) for part of Week 4 and all of Week 5. Flacco looks like he still has plenty of gas left in the tank at age 39, but even if he gets another start for the Colts in Week 6, he will struggle to keep posting prolific numbers against a Titans defense that's allowing the fewest passing yards per game in the NFL. Flacco will certainly be an option in superflex and two-QB formats if Richardson's ruled out again, but he falls outside the QB1 range."
Will Levis,Titans,QB,6,"Will Levis sprained the AC joint in his throwing shoulder in Week 4, and he hasn't resumed practicing coming out of Tennessee's Week 5 bye. He still has a chance to return and start against the Colts in Week 6, but Levis would be no better than a low-end QB2 if he plays, even against an Indianapolis defense that's allowing a league-high 419.2 scrimmage yards per game. Levis has turned the ball over nine times in fewer than 13 quarters of play this season and averaged only 193 passing yards per game in his three full games. Mason Rudolph would start if Levis sits."
Andy Dalton,Panthers,QB,6,"Andy Dalton will start Week 6 vs. the Falcons after being replaced by Bryce Young late in last week's game. Dalton could get nothing going in Week 5's loss to the Bears, throwing for 136 yards, no touchdowns and one interception. Young came into the game with about four minutes remaining, but coach Dave Canales said afterward that Dalton is still QB1. Dalton faces a Falcons defense that has been middle of the road against fantasy quarterbacks, but that's probably enough to stifle the Panthers' weak passing attack."
Jahmyr Gibbs,Lions,RB,6,"Jahmyr Gibbs will look to keep up his momentum in the running game as Detroit prepares for a Week 6 matchup against the Cowboys. The dynamic second-year pro has scored four times in as many games to kick off the 2024 regular season and is averaging an excellent 5.3 yards per carry. Gibbs has just 76 receiving yards on the season, demonstrating that his usage in the passing game hasn't exactly lived up to projections, but he's nonetheless averaging just over 100 scrimmage yards per contest. Both Gibbs and backfield mate David Montgomery have logged double-digit rush attempts in each of the Lions games this season, so a week of rest could benefit both versus a Dallas defense that ranks bottom-10 against the run."
Deshaun Watson,Browns,QB,6,"Deshaun Watson's disastrous start to the 2024 season for Cleveland continued in Week 5 against the Commanders as he has yet to average more than 5.5 yards per attempt in any game. The end result has been Watson failing to reach 200 passing yards in any matchup while tallying multiple touchdowns just once. Though he's heading into a Week 6 matchup against an Eagles' defense that was most recently exploited by Baker Mayfield, there's no way to confidently start Watson."
Aidan O'Connell,Raiders,QB,6,"Aidan O'Connell replaced Gardner Minshew late in the Raiders Week 5 loss to the Broncos, the second time in the last three games he's been handed the reins. As yet, Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce has declined to name a starter for Week 6, but O'Connell appears to be on the verge of getting his first start of 2024. Unfortunately, he might be taking over at the worst possible time, as Davante Adams could be traded before the team takes the field again, leaving Las Vegas with one of the league's weakest wide receiver groups. If he is under center in Week 6, O'Connell will face a Steelers defense that ranks 10th in QB rating against."
Drake London,Falcons,WR,6,"Drake London heads to Carolina in Week 6 looking for another big game after last week's career day. London had career highs in targets (13) and catches (12) in Atlanta's Week 5 overtime win against the Buccaneers, totaling 154 yards and a touchdown. The Falcons aren't likely to throw 58 times again, but London has had at least nine targets in three consecutive games, so it's possible he approaches double-digit targets again. The weak Panthers defense is bottom 10 in most receiving stats vs. wide receivers this season."
Tony Pollard,Titans,RB,6,"Tony Pollard has 61 carries to Tyjae Spears' 29 through the Titans' first four games, and Pollard should continue to lead Tennessee's backfield in a favorable Week 6 matchup against a Colts defense that has allowed 827 scrimmage yards to RBs, second-most in the NFL. He's fresh with the Titans coming out of a Week 5 bye and will be a high-end RB2 regardless of whether Will Levis (shoulder) or Mason Rudolph starts at QB. Pollard should remain heavily involved even if the Titans fall behind, as he also leads the team with 13 receptions."
CeeDee Lamb,Cowboys,WR,6,"CeeDee Lamb has yet to cross the 100-yard receiving mark in a game this season. Lamb caught five passes for 62 yards last game for Dallas. However, Lamb has at least seven targets in every contest. Lamb will look to cross the 100-yard plateau in Week 6 versus a Lions defense that has been surprisingly suspect against the pass in 2024. Detroit is allowing 258.3 passing yards per tilt this season, which is 27th in the league. However, Detroit has only allowed four passing touchdowns through four contests, which is tied for seventh in the NFL."
Jordan Mason,49ers,RB,6,"Jordan Mason rushed 14 times for 89 yards, and he caught his lone target for nine yards. Mason played in just 63-percent of the 49ers snaps over the weekend, his lowest snap share of the season. While Mason still figures to be San Francisco's primary option out of the backfield, Isaac Guerendo and Deebo Samuel getting carries is a slight negative impact for him moving forward. Mason is still a strong fantasy option heading into a Week 6 game against the Seahawks. Seattle's rushing defense is allowing 128 yards per game in 2024, ranking 20th in the league."
Josh Jacobs,Packers,RB,6,"Josh Jacobs will remain a featured piece of Green Bay's offense as the team prepares to host the Cardinals in Week 6. The veteran running back logged his second game of the season with 20-plus touches during Week 5's win over the Rams, in which he rushed 19 times for 73 yards and a touchdown and secured his lone target for 21 yards. Despite having already logged 90 carries through five appearances, Jacobs' rushing touchdown versus Los Angeles was also his first time reaching the end zone this season. Jacobs has been efficient on the year (4.5 YPC) and he's already logged as many runs of 20-plus yards (three) as he did in 13 games with the Raiders last season. He'll continue leading Green Bay's backfield, with Emanuel Wilson working in the No. 2 role, at home versus Arizona."
David Montgomery,Lions,RB,6,"David Montgomery will work to keep up his momentum Week 6 against a Cowboys defense that ranks bottom-10 against the run. The veteran running back has scored in all of Detroit's first four games this season, with both he and backfield mate Jahmyr Gibbs totaling four total TDs each on the year. Montgomery has already totaled 64 rush attempts (for 271 yards), so coming off a bye could well benefit him after a sizable early-season workload. Montgomery has also logged solid usage in the receiving game this year, including a career-long 40-yard reception (on his only target) against the Seahawks in Week 4. On the other hand, Gibbs has started seeing action in short-yardage work that Montgomery once dominated, and he turned in two rushing scores from inside the five-yard line Week 4. Both backs have been deployed relatively interchangeably early in the 2024 campaign, a development that sets Montgomery and Gibbs both up for success versus Dallas."
James Cook,Bills,RB,6,"James Cook's efficient usage is his greatest asset as he's coming off of a 22-touch outing in Week 5, despite a fourth-straight week where he's played 58% or fewer of the Bills offensive snaps. There's no reason to expect Cook's involvement to wane in Week 6's Monday night affair against the Jets, whose defense is yielding 4.2 yards per carry but is stingier against the pass. Cook remains a borderline RB1."
Chuba Hubbard,Panthers,RB,6,"Chuba Hubbard will aim for his third 100-yard rushing performance in his last four games Week 6 against the Falcons. Hubbard just missed triple digits in Week 5, rushing for 97 yards on 13 carries, including a 38-yard TD run. The Falcons are tough against the run, however, allowing the fourth-fewest fantasy points per game to running backs. After 17 touches last week, Hubbard needs his workload to return to the 24 touches he averaged the previous two games, including 11 in the red zone and five inside the 10-yard line."
Breece Hall,Jets,RB,6,Breece Hall has notched at least a 71% snap share in every game but has only 19 total carries for 27 combined yards over Weeks 4 and 5. Hall was a first-round pick; patience is warranted. Week 6 presents a favorable Week 6 Monday night matchup against a vulnerable Bills defense allowing 5.2 yards per carry.
Austin Ekeler,Commanders,RB,6,"Austin Ekeler racked up nearly 100 scrimmage yards last game for the Commanders. Ekeler rushed six times for 67 yards in the 34-13 win over the Browns, while also catching two passes for 30 yards out of the backfield. Unfortunately, Brian Robinson scored twice and Jeremy McNichols scored once, leaving Ekeler as the lone running back who failed to record a touchdown. In Week 6, Ekeler will face a Baltimore defense that has been extremely stingy against the run. Baltimore is allowing just 60.4 rushing yards per clash, which leads the NFL. However, Baltimore has surrendered five rushing touchdowns, which is tied for 18th in the league. Ekeler is much more likely to have success through the air, as Baltimore is allowing over 280 passing yards per tilt, which is 31st in the league."
James Conner,Cardinals,RB,6,"James Conner continued his strong season with 19 carries for 86 rushing yards, and he caught two of his three targets for 14 yards. Conner continues to be the primary option in Arizona's backfield, with Trey Benson occasionally playing a few snaps and Emari Demercado taking on some passing down work. With this type of workload, Conner is a reliable weekly fantasy starter. In Week 6, the Cardinals have a road trip to Green Bay. The Packers' run defense ranks 11th in the league this season, allowing 114 yards per game."
Ja'Marr Chase,Bengals,WR,6,"After a slow start to the season, Ja'Marr Chase has reestablished himself as one of the best pass catchers in the league by finding the end zone in each of the last three games while tallying no fewer than 85 receiving yards in that span. He was particularly productive in Cincinnati's Week 5 loss to the Ravens by tallying a pair of touchdown receptions of more than 40 yards. Chase now heads into a Week 6 matchup against the Giants, a defensive unit that has yet to allow a 100-yard receiver this season paired with only six touchdowns surrendered to opposing wide receivers in five games. Even if it's not the ideal opponent, Chase is an easy option to plug into fantasy lineups with high-end WR1 expectations."
Deebo Samuel Sr.,49ers,WR,6,"Deebo Samuel caught just one of his three targets for 11 yards over the weekend, and he added nine rushing yards off of three carries. This was Samuel's worst game of the season, and Brock Purdy preferred to target Brandon Aiyuk and George Kittle. Despite this poor performance, Samuel still played 52 of 64 offensive snaps, and the handful of rushing attempts he receives per game give a slight boost to his floor in fantasy. Samuel will look to have a stronger performance in San Francisco's Week 6 game against Seattle. The Seahawks have the seventh best passing defense in the league this season, allowing 183 yards per game."
Najee Harris,Steelers,RB,6,"Najee Harris operated as Pittsburgh's lead back by default against Dallas, as both Cordarrelle Patterson (ankle) and Jaylen Warren (knee) were sidelined. However, it was another poor performance, as he averaged just 3.0 yards per carry and has now averaged more than 4.0 yards per attempt in just one game this season. The good news is that he has salvaged his last two games with good efforts as a pass catcher, but career history suggests that won't be sustainable. If the Steelers' backfield remains depleted, Harris is a passable RB2 option in Week 6 against a Raiders defense that has allowed the second-most yards per carry in the league. If either of Warren and Patterson can return, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Harris lose work, so his fantasy viability will be dictated by the injury report."
Justin Herbert,Chargers,QB,6,"Justin Herbert played through an ankle injury for the early part of the Chargers' schedule, but the team's Week 5 bye may have given him a chance to get healthier. While he does have a respectable 64.8% completion rate and 5:1 TD:INT, his 6.4 yards per attempt is a career low. Young wideouts Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston have accounted for all five of those touchdowns, and Herbert's numbers could improve as they continue their development. He faces a stiff test in Week 6 against a Broncos defense that ranks fifth in the league with a 75.5 QB rating against."
Bucky Irving,Buccaneers,RB,6,"Bucky Irving had nine carries for 44 yards in Week 5, and he caught both of his targets for 12 yards. Irving had one fewer carry and target than Rachaad White, and he played in 23 offensive snaps compared to White's 34 snaps. While Irving has been more efficient than White in the running game, he has yet to pass White on the depth chart. But he's expected to handle the bulk of the backfield work Week 6 at the Saints as White is doubtful to play. The Saints rank seventh against the run, allowing 97 yards per game."
J.K. Dobbins,Chargers,RB,6,"J.K. Dobbins has logged double-digit carries in every game this season for the Chargers, an impressive accomplishment in itself given his checked injury history. The running back has done more than stay healthy though, as his 6.1 yards per carry is first in the NFL among RBs with at least 50 totes. Dobbins has emerged as the No. 1 back in a Greg Roman offense, a role that should keep him productive as long as he can stay on the field. In Week 6 he'll take on a Broncos defense that ranks in the top 10 in yards per carry allowed and rushing yards per game allowed."
Terry McLaurin,Commanders,WR,6,"Terry McLaurin crossed the 100-yard receiving mark for the second time in three games for the Commanders. McLaurin snagged four passes for 112yards in the 34-13 thrashing of the Browns. McLaurin has caught 15 passes for 262 yards and two touchdowns over the last three outings. In Week 6, McLaurin will face a Ravens defense that has been destroyed through the air. Baltimore is allowing an average of 280.2 passing yards per tilt, which is 31st in the NFL. In addition, the Ravens have allowed nine throwing scores, which is tied for 25th in the NFL. Last game, the Ravens surrendered 392 passing yards and five touchdowns through the air to Cincy quarterback Joe Burrow."
Tyrone Tracy Jr.,Giants,RB,6,"Tyrone Tracy rushed for 129 yards on 18 carries in place of the injured Devin Singletary, helping vault the New York Giants to a stunning win over the Seattle Seahawks. After fellow running back Eric Gray suffered a disastrous fumble on the goal line early in the game, the rookie Tracy took over and broke off several big runs for the G-Men en route to the career day. It remains to be seen if Singletary will be able to suit up for the Week 6 clash with the Bengals, but if he cannot, Tracy would likely be called upon again to shoulder the majority of the rushing load. Cincinnati has been abysmal against the run in 2024, allowing 151.4 yards per game on the ground, which is 30th in the league."
Garrett Wilson,Jets,WR,6,"Garrett Wilson drew a whopping 22 targets in Week 5 after collecting only 34 total opportunities through the Jets first four games, converting them into 13 catches for 101 yards and a touchdown. While the volume is welcomed, Week 5 marked the third straight game Wilson has gone for under 8.3 yards per reception and he has just two catches of 20-plus yards on the year. A Week 6 matchup against the Bills isn't encouraging as they have limited opposing passing games to just 6.2 yards per attempt, with only eight plays of 20 yards or greater. Still, volume keeps Wilson living in the WR1 neighborhood."
A.J. Brown,Eagles,WR,6,"A.J. Brown will have the benefit of the bye week to see if he can return to the field for a Week 6 clash with the Cleveland Browns. Philadelphia's passing attack looked lifeless without either Brown or DeVonta Smith in an ugly 33-16 loss to the Bucs prior to the bye. However, even if Brown can suit up, success is far from guaranteed. Cleveland is allowing just 184.4 passing yards per outing, which is eighth in the league."
Trey Sermon,Colts,RB,6,"Trey Sermon had 10 carries and six targets in Jonathan Taylor's (ankle) Week 5 absence against the Jaguars, presenting a blueprint for Sermon's potential Week 6 workload against the Titans with Taylor sidelined again by a high-ankle sprain. Sermon is likely to lead the Colts' backfield again in Week 6, with Tyler Goodson also mixing in after racking up five carries and three targets in Week 5. Sermon found the end zone in Week 5 and is a fantasy RB2 against a Titans defense that has allowed one rushing TD and a league-high three receiving TDs to RBs in four games."
Travis Etienne Jr.,Jaguars,RB,6,"Travis Etienne appears to have been supplanted by Tank Bigsby as Jacksonville's top RB on early downs, as Etienne rushed for 67 yards on 17 carries in Weeks 4 and 5 compared to Bigsby's 191 yards and two TDs on 20 carries over that span. Etienne had six catches in Week 5 against the Colts while Bigsby was targeted only once, so at least Etienne is still the backfield choice in passing situations. His contributions as a receiver could prove pivotal in Week 6 against a Bears defense that allowed the most receiving yards in the NFL to RBs last season, though Chicago has been about league average in receiving contributions allowed to RBs this season while giving up six rushing TDs to the position. With Bigsby encroaching significantly on his playing time and fantasy value, Etienne's a low-end RB2 or flex play in Week 6."
Brandon Aiyuk,49ers,WR,6,"Brandon Aiyuk caught eight of his 12 targets for 147 yards last weekend in his best performance of the season. Aiyuk led the 49ers' receivers in snaps and routes run, and it was his second game of the season where he was targeted ten or more times. With this type of utilization, Aiyuk should remain a strong fantasy option moving forward. San Francisco plays Seattle in Week 6, and the Seahawks have allowed 183 passing yards per game in 2024, seventh best in the league."
Zack Moss,Bengals,RB,6,"Zack Moss split Week 5 work evenly with Chase Brown out of the Cincinnati backfield for the second consecutive week and was held to less than 4.0 yards per carry for the third time in five games this season. The momentum appears to be in Brown's favor, and matters were made worse when Moss suffered a minor ankle injury late in the Bengals' Week 5 loss to the Ravens. Assuming he's able to suit up for a Week 6 matchup against the Giants, Moss remains an RB2/flex option thanks to his work as a pass catcher, as he's now tallied at least three receptions in each of the last three weeks."
Amon-Ra St. Brown,Lions,WR,6,"Amon-Ra St. Brown and the Lions return from a bye to take on the Cowboys in Week 6. The star wide receiver's yardage totals have been somewhat disappointing through the early portion of the 2024 campaign - he had just 45 yards against the Seahawks in Week 4 - but St. Brown has nonetheless managed to make a clear impact with his opportunities. St. Brown scored his second receiving TD of the year Week 4 and also threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to quarterback Jared Goff. Across 16 regular-season appearances in 2023, St. Brown averaged 94.7 receiving yards per game, a mark that has declined to 63 yards per game early in the 2024 season. Coming off the bye, St. Brown and offensive coordinator Ben Johnson will look to collaborate on more consistent receiving production going forward."
Jayden Reed,Packers,WR,6,"Jayden Reed will look to continue his hot streak as the Packers host the Cardinals in Week 6. He salvaged his performance against the Rams in Week 5 with a big play, hauling in a 53-yard deep ball on Green Bay's second possession. He finished the day with just four catches for 78 yards on six targets, though, in addition to two carries for 19 yards. Aside from Week 2, which was Malik Willis' first start, Reed has displayed a six-target floor this season. Reed's pathway to the No. 1 role in Green Bay has been unorthodox, as he lacks both the prototypical size and target volume for such a role, but his versatility and big-play ability make him an instrumental offensive weapon for QB Jordan Love. Reed figures to benefit from fellow starter Romeo Doubs rejoining the lineup versus Arizona."
Darnell Mooney,Falcons,WR,6,"Darnell Mooney and the Falcons travel to Carolina in Week 6 looking to build on last week's huge passing game. Mooney turned a team-leading 16 targets into nine catches for 105 yards and two scores in Atlanta's Week 5 overtime win against the Buccaneers. He won't see near that many targets this week. The Falcons aren't likely to throw 58 times again and Mooney's previous season high was eight targets. It's possible he approaches that number again, though, as the weak Panthers defense is bottom 10 in most receiving stats vs. wide receivers this season."
DK Metcalf,Seahawks,WR,6,"DK Metcalf had a modest performance compared to his usual standards, catching four of his seven targets for 55 yards. Metcalf played on every offensive snap for Seattle, and he should continue to operate as Seattle's top receiving option moving forward. Metcalf is averaging over eight targets per game, and his 421 receiving yards are fourth best in the league. In Week 6, the Seahawks host the 49ers. San Francisco's passing defense is 12th best in the league this season, allowing 197 yards per game."
Rico Dowdle,Cowboys,RB,6,"Rico Dowdle finally had his breakout performance for the Cowboys. Dowdle racked up over 100 scrimmage yards in Sunday's win over the Steelers. Dowdle rushed 20 times for 87 yards, while also catching two balls for 27 yards and a touchdown out of the backfield. While fellow running back Ezekiel Elliott did have six carries, he managed just 17 yards, and thus any notion of a timeshare can likely be put to bed. Dowdle has also scored in back-to-back games. In Week 6, Dowdle will face a stout Lions run defense. Detroit is allowing just 90.8 rushing yards per clash, which is third in the NFL."
Stefon Diggs,Texans,WR,6,"Stefon Diggs could find himself atop Houston's WR depth chart in Week 6 against the Patriots if Nico Collins (hamstring) doesn't play. Diggs' 41 targets are only four shy of Collins' season total, but Diggs is averaging only 7.7 yards per target compared to Collins' 12.6, as Diggs is best utilized underneath at this stage of his career. An expected uptick in volume would push Diggs into the fringe fantasy WR1 range should Collins sit, but Diggs would remain a low-end WR2 otherwise in Week 6 against a Patriots defense that's allowing 164.2 receiving yards per game to WRs."
Diontae Johnson,Panthers,WR,6,"Diontae Johnson hopes to rebound Week 6 against the Falcons from a disappointing performance last week. Johnson caught only three of six targets for 23 yards in a forgettable Week 5 game against the Bears. Andy Dalton was so ineffective, he was replaced late in the game by Bryce Young. Dalton will start this week, and the Falcons are only middle of the road against fantasy wide receivers, so perhaps Johnson can get back on track after totaling 15 receptions, 205 yards and two touchdowns the previous two weeks."
DJ Moore,Bears,WR,6,"DJ Moore will continue to lead Chicago's receiving corps as the team prepares for an international Week 6 matchup against the Jaguars. The star wide receiver paved the way for the best game of rookie quarterback Caleb Williams' career versus Carolina in Week 5, securing five of eight targets for 105 yards and two touchdowns. The clear No. 1 receiving option for the Bears set a new season-high mark in terms of receiving yards and now has three scores in his last two appearances. He'll look to continue demonstrating exceptional chemistry with Williams versus a beatable Jaguars secondary, with Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze also working in three-wide sets."
Tee Higgins,Bengals,WR,6,"Tee Higgins has operated as Cincinnati's top target earner since returning to full health, as he's recorded 24 combined targets across the last two weeks. In contrast to teammate Ja'Marr Chase, Higgins has been limited primarily to short gains as he has yet to log a reception of at least 20 yards on any of his 18 catches this season. Higgins relies on continued volume and touchdowns in a Week 6 matchup against the Giants, a team that has surprisingly been nearly exactly league average in terms of fantasy points allowed to opposing wide receivers. Higgins projects a WR2/WR3 option."
Marvin Harrison Jr.,Cardinals,WR,6,"Marvin Harrison ranked second on Arizona with seven targets, but he only recorded two receptions for 36 yards over the weekend. Harrison's catch rate is below 50 percent in his rookie campaign, which is well below the league average. While Harrison needs to improve his efficiency, he continues to lead Arizona's wide receivers in snaps and routes run. He stands to continue to be targeted heavily by Kyler Murray in Arizona's Week 6 matchup against the Packers. Green Bay has allowed 232 passing yards per game this season, ranking 23rd in the league."
Chris Godwin,Buccaneers,WR,6,"Chris Godwin caught five of his six targets for 64 yards in Week 5. This was a season low in targets and receptions for Godwin, but he continued to lead the Buccaneers wide receivers in snaps, and his low target volume can be attributed to the fact that Baker Mayfield only attempted 24 total passing attempts. Mayfield should continue to target Godwin heavily moving forward, and Tampa Bay's Week 6 matchup against the Saints should be a favorable one. New Orleans has the league's 24th ranked passing defense this season, allowing 234 passing yards per game."
George Kittle,49ers,TE,6,"Kittle tied Brandon Aiyuk for the most targets last weekend, catching eight of his 12 targets for 64 receiving yards and a touchdown. It was Kittle's third straight start with a touchdown reception. Kittle ranks third among tight ends earning 7.3 targets per game this season, and his 56 receiving yards per game ranks fourth overall at the position. He has a solid matchup in Week 6, where the 49ers take on the Seahawks. Seattle has allowed 286 receiving yards to tight ends this season, fourth most in the league."
Antonio Gibson,Patriots,RB,6,"Despite starting over Rhamondre Stevenson, Antonio Gibson garnered seven touches and a 47% snap share for the Patriots in Week 5, Gibson was efficient, gaining 56 yards, but the Patriots offense remains among the slowest and least potent in the league. Week 6's home matchup with a Texans' defense allowing a generous 4.8 yards per carry is intriguing, but a lack of volume limits Gibson to a fringe flex option."
Alexander Mattison,Raiders,RB,6,"Alexander Mattison got the start in Week 5 with Zamir White sidelined due to a groin injury, but he did little with the opportunity. Mattison gained just 38 rushing yards on 15 carries, although he did turn three targets into two catches for 23 yards. Neither back has seen much success on the ground behind the Raiders' shaky offensive line, and the entire offense could be about to undergo a severe shakeup with Davante Adams on the trade block, and Gardner Minshew potentially set to be replaced at quarterback by Aidan O'Connell. Even if White sits again, that turmoil won't do Mattison any favors in Week 6 against a Steelers defense that ranks in the top five in yards per carry allowed and rushing yards per game allowed."
Tank Dell,Texans,WR,6,"Tank Dell is averaging just 34.3 receiving yards per game this season, but at least he suited up without limitations for the Texans in Week 5 after missing Week 4 due to a chest injury. He has a chance to break out in Week 6 against the Patriots, especially if the Texans are without top WR Nico Collins (hamstring), as Collins and Stefon Diggs each have over 40 targets while Dell has been limited to 21 targets as Houston's No. 3 wideout. New England's giving up 164.2 yards per game to WRs, so Dell's a high-end fantasy WR3 if Collins sits, or a passable flex play otherwise."
Zay Flowers,Ravens,WR,6,"In his three games with double-digit targets this season, Zay Flowers has combined to record 20 catches for 309 yards and a touchdown. However, the Baltimore offense still runs through its ground game, resulting in Flowers virtually disappearing in some weeks. A Week 6 matchup against the Commanders shapes up to be a potentially high-scoring affair, making Flowers a reasonable WR2 -- but with a significant risk of disappointing."
Mike Evans,Buccaneers,WR,6,"Mike Evans caught five of his seven targets for 62 yards and two touchdowns in Week 5. Evans is now up to five touchdown receptions on the season, and the veteran also has a strong 23.7 percent target share. Evans will look to continue his solid start to the season in Week 6 as Tampa Bay faces off against the Saints. New Orleans has the league's 24th ranked passing defense this season, allowing 234 passing yards per game."
Chase Brown,Bengals,RB,6,"In Week 5, Chase Brown earned double-digit carries for the second consecutive game and has moved into an even split for work with Zack Moss. However, he could get a chance to serve as a true lead back in a Week 6 matchup against the Giants, pending the health of Moss after he suffered an ankle injury late in Cincinnati's Week 5 loss to the Ravens. If Moss is able to suit up, Brown is a risky start even with his increased involvement and big-play ability, as he hasn't gotten much work at the goal line or as a pass catcher through five games."
Javonte Williams,Broncos,RB,6,"Javonte Williams is coming off his best performance of the season, topping 100 scrimmage yards for the first time in the Broncos' Week 5 win over the Raiders. The fourth year running back busted out for 138 rushing yards and 4.8 yards per carry over the last two games while adding seven grabs for 53 yards on nine targets as a pass-catcher, solidifying his spot at the top of the RB depth chart. Williams is still seeking his first touchdown of 2024, but as the Denver offense improves around him, he should get opportunities to find the end zone. He'll face a stingy Chargers run defense in Week 6 that ranks in the top five in yards per carry allowed and rushing yards per game allowed."
George Pickens,Steelers,WR,6,"George Pickens remains Pittsburgh's top pass-catching option, collecting at least seven targets in four of five games this season. That hasn't led to consistent fantasy results, as he's been held below 50 receiving yards twice and has still yet to reach the end zone. A Week 6 matchup against the Raiders does create an opportunity for Pickens to perform well, as they have allowed two wide receivers to reach 20 points this season. Pickens is a comfortable WR3/FLEX option, but he has wide variance in both directions."
Brian Thomas Jr.,Jaguars,WR,6,"Brian Thomas leads the Jaguars in every major receiving category heading into a Week 6 meeting with the Bears in London. The rookie first-round pick had a career-high 122 receiving yards in the Week 5 win over the Colts and scored his third TD in five NFL games. Chicago will likely offer more resistance, as the Bears have limited WRs to one TD in 2024, but Thomas is a WR2 even in this challenging matchup."
Younghoe Koo,Falcons,K,6,"Younghoe Koo will look to continue his recent string of strong kicking performances Week 6 against the Panthers. The last three weeks, Koo is 8-for-10 from beyond 40 yards, including five 50-plus conversions, and a 7-for-7 on extra-point tries. He was three of five on field-goal attempts last week, but one was blocked, a 54-yarder. He also hit a 52-yard field goal to send the game to overtime. The Panthers allow the seventh-most fantasy points per game to kickers this season."
Justin Tucker,Ravens,K,6,"Justin Tucker answered questions about his ability to convert field goals from distance by knocking through a 56-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter of Baltimore's Week 5 win over the Bengals. The performance also marked the first time since Week 2 that he's made multiple field goals. Tucker's name value outweighs his production heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Commanders, a defense that has allowed only eight field-goal attempts through five games on the campaign."
DeVonta Smith,Eagles,WR,6,"DeVonta Smith will have the benefit of the bye week to see if he can return to the field for a Week 6 clash with the Cleveland Browns. Philadelphia's passing attack looked lifeless without either Smith or A.J. Brown in an ugly 33-16 loss to the Bucs prior to the bye. However, even if Smith can suit up, success is far from guaranteed. Cleveland is allowing just 184.4 passing yards per outing, which is eighth in the league."
Jake Bates,Lions,K,6,"Jake Bates will hope to be more involved as the Lions face off against the Cowboys in Week 6. The starting kicker has now gone back-to-back games without a single field-goal attempt, though he's converted eight of nine PATs in that span. In the Lions' first two games of the season, Bates converted all five of his field-goal tries and was perfect on three PATs, but neither of the team's last two games have put him in position to handle much action. He'll hope for a less quiet day on the road in Dallas."
Austin Seibert,Commanders,K,6,"Austin Seibert has been one of the chief beneficiaries of Washington's offensive explosion of late. The Commanders are averaging 38 points over the last three games, with Seibert booting 13 extra-points over that span. He has also connected on five field goals during that time period as well, including two this past Sunday against the Browns. In Week 6, the Commanders will face a Ravens squad that has been far more suspect defensively than usual. Baltimore is allowing 25.2 points per tilt, which is 26th in the league."
Wan'Dale Robinson,Giants,WR,6,"Wan'Dale Robinson continues to operate as the safety valve for quarterback Daniel Jones and the New York Giants. Robinson snagged six passes for 36 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's surprising 29-20 win over the Seattle Seahawks. Robinson has drawn at least eight targets in four of five games this season for the G-Men. In Week 6, the Giants will clash with a subpar Bengals defense. Cincinnati has been mediocre at best against the pass in 2024, allowing 214 yards per clash through the air, which is 19th in the NFL. The Bengals have also allowed 10 passing touchdowns already this season, which is tied for 28th in the league."
Ka'imi Fairbairn,Texans,K,6,"Ka'imi Fairbairn has connected on 11 of 12 field-goal attempts heading into the Texans' Week 6 road game against the Patriots. He has been one of the top kickers in the league, and Fairbairn beat the Bills at the buzzer with a 59-yard field goal to secure a 23-20 Week 5 win. The Patriots are allowing only 20.4 points per game, but a talented Texans offense shouldn't have too many problems moving the ball and will likely continue to create plentiful opportunities for Fairbairn, even if Houston's without Nico Collins (hamstring). Keep starting Fairbairn if you have him."
Brandon Aubrey,Cowboys,K,6,"Brandon Aubrey has attempted more field goals than any other kicker in the NFL through five games. While Aubrey has failed on two kicks over the last two games, he has still made at least two field goals in each of the first five contests for the Cowboys. He has also yet to miss an extra point. In Week 6, Aubrey and company will face a Detroit squad allowing 20.5 points per contest, which is 10th in the NFL."
Chase McLaughlin,Buccaneers,K,6,"Chase McLaughlin converted all three of his extra point attempts, and he went 3-for-3 on his field goal attempts, as well. McLaughlin has been impressive this season, making all of his field goal attempts so far, including going 5-for-5 on attempts of 50 or more yards. McLaughlin will look to continue his strong start to the 2024 season in a Week 6 matchup against New Orleans. The Saints indoor stadium is a favorable kicking environment, though New Orleans' defense has allowed just 17.5 points per game this season, seventh best in the league."
Jerome Ford,Browns,RB,6,"Even with Nick Chubb (knee) sidelined, Jerome Ford has failed to take hold of Cleveland's backfield. He's gathered 13 or fewer total touches in three of the team's last four games, though his Week 5 performance against the Commanders was the first time Ford has been held under 50 total yards from scrimmage. A Week 6 matchup against the Eagles should offer him solid opportunity as both a rusher and receiver -- the Eagles have allowed 5.13 yards per carry, the third-highest mark in the league -- but the ineptitude of the Cleveland offense combined with Ford's uncertain volume make him an unreliable option."
Chris Boswell,Steelers,K,6,"Chris Boswell has made 12 of his 13 field-goal attempts for the Steelers this season, though he has only one field-goal attempt in Wee 4 and Week 5. A Week 6 matchup against the Raiders could provide a bounce back opportunity for as Las Vegas has allowed the fifth-most field goal attempts to opponents this season. Overall, Boswell should be considered as a starting option due to his accuracy, but he does carry risk due to Pittsburgh's conservative and often ineffective offense."
Cairo Santos,Bears,K,6,"Cairo Santos will look to remain steady as the Bears travel to London for a Week 6 contest against the Jaguars. The veteran kicker has now been limited to one field-goal conversion in three straight contests, and in Week 5's win over Carolina he missed one of four PATs. On the year, Santos has converted eight of nine field-goal tries and nine of 10 extra-point attempts. His production has been somewhat unpredictable due to Chicago's inconsistent offense, but Caleb Williams has looked more poised as of late and will have a chance to truly find his footing against Jacksonville's unimpressive secondary."
Jake Elliott,Eagles,K,6,"Jake Elliott has failed to see many opportunities thus far in 2024 as the Eagles offense has struggled. Elliott has attempted just five field goals in four games. Philadelphia could get either A.J. Brown or DeVonta Smith, or both, back in Week 6 versus the Browns, which should provide a jolt to the offense. Cleveland is allowing 24.2 points per contest, which is 23rd in the NFL."
Evan McPherson,Bengals,K,6,"Evan McPherson missed his lone field-goal attempt in Week 5, though it was the result of a botched hold. Nevertheless, he's had an inconsistent start to the season, including either a missed extra point or field goal in three of Cincinnati's last four games. On the other hand, he's also converted multiple field goals on three occasions, making him a decent kicking option in a Week 6 matchup against the Giants."
Michael Pittman Jr.,Colts,WR,6,"Michael Pittman has posted 40 or more receiving yards only once through the Colts' first five games heading into a Week 6 trip to Tennessee. Indianapolis' entire passing game would have a higher ceiling in Week 6 if Joe Flacco continues to fill in for Anthony Richardson (oblique) at QB, as Flacco threw for 359 yards and three TDs, including one to Pittman, while making a spot start against the Jaguars in Week 5. Pittman will likely see a heavy dose of shutdown Titans cornerback L'Jarius Sneed, so Pittman's more of a WR3/flex play for fantasy purposes in Week 6, even if Flacco gets another start."
Rashid Shaheed,Saints,WR,6,"Rashid Shaheed led the Saints in targets, catching four of his nine targets for 86 yards and a touchdown in Week 5. Shaheed showed off his ability as a deep threat with his 43 yard touchdown reception, his third of the season. Though Shaheed might have some inconsistency due to his high average depth of target, he still gets plenty of opportunities and leads the Saints in targets this season. As long as Derek Carr is available to start after suffering an oblique injury. Shaheed and the Saints have a solid matchup against a struggling Tampa Bay passing defense in Week 6. The Buccaneers have allowed 258 passing yards per game this season, ranking 28th in the league."
Matthew Wright,49ers,K,6,"The 49ers signed Matthew Wright earlier in the week, and he will serve as the team's starting kicker in Week 6. For the next few weeks, Wright will replace Jake Moody, who suffered a high-ankle sprain. In the past four seasons, Wright has converted 85 percent of his field goals, with a career long of 59 yards. In Week 6, San Francisco faces off against the Seahawks. Seattle's defense has allowed 22.8 points per game this season, ranking 18th in the league."
Jameson Williams,Lions,WR,6,"Jameson Williams will look to continue putting together a verifiable breakout campaign as the Lions take on the Cowboys in Week 6. Despite drawing just two targets versus the Seahawks in Week 4, Williams led Detroit with 80 receiving yards (and one touchdown) while securing both of his looks from quarterback Jared Goff. The 2022 first-round pick has definitively demonstrated the electric playmaking ability that convinced the Lions to draft him 12th overall three years ago, with over 70 receiving yards in three of four games on the season, plus two touchdowns in that span. Still, Williams has shown a true boom-or-bust floor, as displayed Week 3 against the Cardinals when he logged just one three-yard catch plus one rush for minus seven yards. Williams has just five targets combined in Detroit's last two games, after having been targeted 20 times in the team's first two games of the season. Coming out of the bye, Williams will look to display better consistency versus Dallas."
Tank Bigsby,Jaguars,RB,6,"Tank Bigsby has broken out for 191 rushing yards and two TDs on 20 carries in Weeks 4 and 5, and he was on the field for one more snap than Travis Etienne in Jacksonville's Week 5 win over the Colts. Backfield timeshares are fantasy kryptonite, and Etienne is the superior pass catching back, but Bigsby will be a popular waiver wire add where available ahead of Jacksonville's Week 6 game against the Bears and can be deployed as a fantasy RB2 considering he's averaging 8.0 yards per carry on 34 attempts in 2024 after plodding to 2.6 yards per carry on 50 rushes as a rookie last season. Chicago's six rushing TDs allowed to RBs are tied for third-most in the NFL."
Gabe Davis,Jaguars,WR,6,"Gabe Davis is a distant No. 3 on Jacksonville's WR depth chart, having caught only 12 of 25 targets for 159 yards through five games with the team. He's unlikely to turn things around in Week 6, as Davis is questionable due to a knee injury against a Bears defense that has allowed only one TD to a WR this season, so Davis is no better than a reserve for fantasy purposes. Brian Thomas and Christian Kirk should continue to account for the majority of the Jaguars' production at the position, and Davis will face further competition for targets if the Jaguars get TE Evan Engram (hamstring) back after a four-game absence."
Eric Gray,Giants,RB,6,"Eric Gray likely ruined any chance of becoming the featured back for the New York Giants with a catastrophic fumble this past Sunday. Gray had the first crack at goal line touches for the Giants with Devin Singletary injured, but fumbled the ball, resulting in a 101-yard fumble return for a touchdown by the Seahawks. New York would go on to win the game, but Gray took a backseat to rookie Tyrone Tracy thereafter, as the latter rushed for 129 yards on 18 carries in the 29-20 win. Gray did catch three passes for 50 yards out of the backfield, but should remain firmly behind both Singletary and Tracy in Week 6 versus the Bengals. Cincy is allowing 151.4 yards per clash on the ground, which is 30th in the NFL, but barring an injury to Tracy, Gray is unlikely to see many carries."
Sam LaPorta,Lions,TE,6,"Sam LaPorta could be poised for his 2024 breakout versus the Cowboys in Week 6, with the Lions coming off a bye. Though the second-year pro, who scored 10 touchdowns as a rookie, has been held out of the end zone thus far this season, he quietly logged a solid game against Seattle in Week 4, securing all four of his targets for 53 yards. Only one of those looks was in the red zone, within 20 yards, and LaPorta's only target inside the 10-yard line came Week 1. Still, LaPorta is coming off his best game of the season in terms of receiving yards, finishing second on the team in terms of both that category and receptions. Offensive coordinator Ben Johnson figures to put his early-season bye to use, so more consistency for LaPorta, and Detroit's passing production as a whole, may arrive without further delay."
Dontayvion Wicks,Packers,WR,6,"Dontayvion Wicks will look to bounce back as the Packers host the Cardinals at home in Week 6. Despite drawing seven targets during Green Bay's 24-19 win over the Rams, Wicks finished with just two catches for 20 yards, demonstrating difficulty getting on the same page with quarterback Jordan Love, especially in deeper areas of the field. Those hiccups were also present Week 4, when Wicks reeled in just five of 13 targets, but he was able to translate those catches into 78 yards and two scores versus Minnesota. With Christian Watson (ankle) expected to remain sidelined Week 6, Wicks will get another chance to start in three-wide sets, even though Romeo Doubs figures to return from his one-game suspension. Wicks will hope to better demonstrate chemistry with Love against Arizona."
Christian Watson,Packers,WR,6,"Christian Watson's ankle injury will likely keep him sidelined during Green Bay's game against the Cardinals in Week 6. Though the third-year pro isn't expected to be placed on IR due to the high left-ankle sprain he sustained Week 4 against Minnesota, the Packers are reportedly bracing for Watson to require a multi-week absence. His realistic targets for retaking the field may be Week 7 against the Texans or Week 8 at Jacksonville. In the meantime, Romeo Doubs figures to return from his one-game suspension and join Jayden Reed and Dontayvion Wicks in three-wide sets versus Arizona."
Tucker Kraft,Packers,TE,6,"Tucker Kraft will look to continue his breakout streak as Green Bay prepares to host Arizona in Week 6. The second-year tight end logged a 5-88-2 receiving line during the Packers' 24-19 win over the Rams in Week 5, giving him three touchdowns in his last two appearances. Even with Luke Musgrave available, Kraft has now handled 80-plus percent of offensive snaps in back-to-back games, demonstrating a solidified role as one of Green Bay's young pillars on offense. The Packers' passing attack will return Rome Doubs from a one-game suspension versus the Cardinals but still be without Christian Watson (ankle), leaving Kraft once again positioned for an increased opportunity share."
David Njoku,Browns,TE,6,"After missing three straight weeks with a high-ankle sprain, David Njoku suited up for the Browns in Week 5, but he mustered only 25 snaps before leaving with a knee injury. Njoku was unable to return, ending his day with one grab on three targets for 14 yards. Njoku is questionable for Week 6's road date with the Eagles, and even if he plays, he's a risk to lose workload to Jordan Akins."
Jaleel McLaughlin,Broncos,RB,6,"Jaleel McLaughlin continues to struggle, managing only 25 yards from scrimmage in a Week 5 win over the Raiders. While he did score his second touchdown of the season on a four-yard toss from Bo Nix, the second-year RB remains firmly behind Javonte Williams in the Broncos' backfield. McLaughlin has a poor 3.3 yards per carry on the season, more than two yards per carry below his performance as a rookie. He's unlikely to break out in Week 6 against a Chargers run defense that ranks in the top five in yards per carry allowed and rushing yards per game allowed."
Justice Hill,Ravens,RB,6,"Justice Hill has flashed strong production as a pass catcher at points during the season as the change-of-pace back in Baltimore. The problem is that he's produced unpredictably, making it difficult to trust him on a weekly basis as he has seven or fewer touches in all but one game this season. There should be better starting options heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Commanders."
Zach Ertz,Commanders,TE,6,"Zach Ertz was targeted eight times last game for Washington, tying with Terry McLaurin for the team lead. Unfortunately, Ertz was only able to bring in two of those passes for a total of 10 yards. Ertz has topped 50 yards receiving just once through five contests. In Week 6, Washington will face a Ravens defense that has been destroyed through the air. Baltimore is allowing an average of 280.2 passing yards per tilt, which is 31st in the NFL. In addition, the Ravens have allowed nine throwing scores, which is tied for 25th in the NFL. Last game, the Ravens surrendered 392 passing yards and five touchdowns through the air to Cincy quarterback Joe Burrow."
Keenan Allen,Bears,WR,6,"Keenan Allen will get another opportunity to continue building chemistry with QB Caleb Williams as the Bears head into a Week 6 international matchup against the Jaguars. The veteran wideout drew six targets during Chicago's win over Carolina in Week 5, but he finished with just three catches for 33 yards. DJ Moore stole headlines with his 105-yard, two-TD performance, but all of Cole Kmet, D'Andre Swift and Rome Odunze also finished ahead of Allen in terms of receiving yardage. The veteran has only been back in action for two games, though, so a slow start isn't necessarily unsurprising. He'll have a solid chance to bounce back in London against a Jacksonville defense that just allowed 359 passing yards to Joe Flacco and the Colts."
Allen Lazard,Jets,WR,6,"Allen Lazard is coming off a Week 5 effort where he scored for the fourth time in five outings while gathering a season-high 10 targets. Week 5 marked the third time where Lazard has garnered at least eight opportunities, but he's been touchdown dependent, topping 60 receiving yards just once. While Allen has QB Aaron Rodgers' trust, a Week 6 matchup against a Bills defense that's allowed just six touchdown passes in five games lands Lazard in WR3 territory."
Quentin Johnston,Chargers,WR,6,"Quentin Johnston comes out of the Chargers' bye with three touchdowns in four games, and he already has more TDs than he did in his entire rookie season in 2023. The 21st overall pick in that year's draft still isn't seeing big volume, managing only 11 catches for 142 yards on 18 targets, but he's already beginning to shed the bust label that clung to him in the offense. The Chargers' run-heavy scheme limits the upside of all its wideouts. but Johnston is earning Justin Herbert's trust with his nose for the end zone. He could have trouble making in impact in Week 6 against a Broncos secondary that's given up the second-fewest receiving yards per game in the league to WRs."
Dallas Goedert,Eagles,TE,6,"Dallas Goedert unsurprisingly led the depleted Eagles in receiving prior to their bye. Without the services of both A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, Goedert caught seven passes for 62 yards on eight targets, all team highs. Certainly, the return of one or both of the aforementioned playmakers would diminish Goedert's targets in Week 6 versus the Browns, but he should still remain a nice safety blanket for quarterback Jalen Hurts. The matchup is not ideal, though, as Philly will face a Cleveland pass defense surrendering 184.4 passing yards per contest, which is eighth in the NFL."
Jaylen Warren,Steelers,RB,6,"Jaylen Warren's frustrating season continued as he missed Pittsburgh's Week 5 matchup against the Cowboys with a knee injury. He failed to practice in any capacity, also placing his availability into question for a Week 6 contest against Las Vegas. Once Warren returns to full health, he has a strong case to have at least an even split in the backfield with Najee Harris due to the latter's inefficiency, making him a reasonable stash candidate."
Keon Coleman,Bills,WR,6,"Week 5 marked Coleman's third game with no more than one reception, though he's making the most of his eight catches with 19.4 yards per catch and two trips to the end zone. The Bills' rookie wideout has garnered at least a 64% snap share in four of his five outings, with 64% number coming in Week 5 with fellow WR Khalil Shakir sidelined by an ankle injury. Coleman will face a Jets defense in Week 6 that's surrendering only 161.2 passing yards per game with just two scoring strikes. At best, Coleman is a Week 6 flex dart, but only if Shakir remains on the shelf."
Dalton Kincaid,Bills,TE,6,"It's been an uninspiring start to the season for Buffalo's Dalton Kincaid, who brought in two catches on six Week 5 targets for 34 yards. Kincaid has found paydirt just one this season and faces a Jets defense in Week 6 that's surrendered only two passing touchdowns all year. Kincaid hasn't produced commensurate with his high draft pick, but with the tight end position being underwhelming so far, fantasy managers must stay the course."
Zach Charbonnet,Seahawks,RB,6,"Zach Charbonnet logged just two carries for 11 yards in Week 5. He was targeted four times in the passing game, finishing with three receptions for 19 yards. The Seahawks only had 11 carries as a team, and Charbonnet played in about a third of Seattle's offensive snaps. This is consistent with his usage this season with Kenneth Walker active. In Week 6, the Seahawks have a home game against the 49ers. San Francisco's run defense has allowed 111 rushing yards per game in 2024, ninth best in the league."
Dalton Schultz,Texans,TE,6,"Dalton Schultz had a season-high six targets and tied his season best with 34 receiving yards in the 23-20 Week 5 win over the Bills, and it's no coincidence that he garnered extra attention from Texans QB C.J. Stroud after top WR Nico Collins exited due to a hamstring injury. Schultz could continue to play a larger role in the passing game against the Patriots in Week 6, and he's capable of stepping up statistically, as evidenced by Schultz's averages of 659 receiving yards and 5.5 TDs per season from 2020-23. Despite the slow start, he'll be a borderline fantasy TE1 against a Patriots defense that has allowed the seventh-most yards per game to TEs this season."
Cade Otton,Buccaneers,TE,6,"Cade Otton caught three of his four targets for 44 yards in Week 5. Otton plays nearly all of Tampa Bay's offensive snaps, but he still generally plays a complementary role in the passing game to Chris Godwin and Mike Evans. Otton will look to score his first touchdown of the season in a Week 6 tilt against the Saints. New Orleans has the league's 24th ranked passing defense this season, allowing 234 passing yards per game. The Saints have allowed 53 yards per game to tight ends in 2024."
Rashod Bateman,Ravens,WR,6,"Rashod Bateman benefitted from a pass-heavy game script for the Ravens in Week 5 against the Bengals, posting a season-best eight targets, four receptions and 58 yards. However, he's managed to top 50 yards just twice this season. Even in a potentially high-scoring affair in a Week 6 matchup with the Commanders, Bateman is best left on the waiver wire or bench."
Tyler Conklin,Jets,TE,6,"As the Jets continue to throw more, Tyler Conklin's opportunities are trending upward. He saw only four targets through the first two weeks, but has seen 23 looks over the last three games, twice topping 54 yards. Conklin hasn't scored and faces a Bills defense in Week 6 that's allowed only six touchdown passes, but with the tight end position lacking depth, Conklin's volume makes him a strong start consideration in even the shallowest of formats."
Jamaal Williams,Saints,RB,6,"Jamaal Williams continued to play as a backup to Alvin Kamara Week 5. He had just two rushes for 9 yards while not earning any targets in the passing game. Williams' eight snaps played were his lowest of the season, and he doesn't have much standalone fantasy value so long as Kamara is healthy. In Week 6, New Orleans goes up against Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers run defense has allowed 120 rushing yards per game, ranking 16th in the league."
DJ Turner,Raiders,WR,6,"DJ Turner registered a career-high four targets in a Week 5 loss to the Broncos, but the third-year wideout caught only one for 12 yards. He's stepped into the No. 3 WR role with Davante Adams sidelined by a hamstring injury, but Adams is now on the trade block and his absence from the Raiders' offense could become permanent. Turner may also be working with a new quarterback, as Aidan O'Connell appears to be on the verge of replacing Gardner Minshew under center. No matter who's throwing him the ball, the Pitt product will be taking on a Steelers secondary in Week 6 that ranks in the top half of the league in catches and touchdowns allowed to WRs."
Jerry Jeudy,Browns,WR,6,"After an abysmal Week 5 showing in Cleveland's loss, Jerry Jeudy has been held under 30 yards in three of five games this season. The positive news is that he has a consistent role in the team's offense, commanding at least six targets in all but one contest. A Week 6 matchup against the weak Eagles' secondary -- they've allowed the fifth-most fantasy points per game to opposing wide receivers -- should keep Jeudy in the flex conversation, but he'll be a risky option until the Browns show some stability on offense."
Emanuel Wilson,Packers,RB,6,"Emanuel Wilson will continue to work behind Josh Jacob out of the backfield as Green Bay prepares for a home matchup against the Cardinals in Week 6. He rushed six times for 24 yards versus the Rams in Week 5, while also securing his only target for minus nine yards. Through five appearances this season Wilson has handled 35 carries to 90 for Jacobs, making his path to production largely dependent on gamescript. With MarShawn Lloyd not eligible to come off IR until Week 7 at the earliest, Wilson will continue handling No. 2 reps for at least one more contest."
Evan Engram,Jaguars,TE,6,"Evan Engram is hoping to make his return from a hamstring injury that has sidelined him since pregame warmups in Week 2. Coach Doug Pederson expressed optimism Monday that the starting TE will be back in Week 6 against the Bears, but Engram's officially listed as questionable. Chicago's allowing only 32.4 yards per game to TEs, but Engram would be worthy of starting in fantasy nonetheless if he gains clearance to suit up, as he averaged 6.7 catches and 56.6 receiving yards per game in 2023."
Jonathan Mingo,Panthers,WR,6,"Jonathan Mingo could get more targets Week 6 against the Falcons if Xavier Legette does not play because of an injury. Legette left last week's game after one catch with a shoulder injury. He underwent tests and is uncertain for this week. However, Mingo saw increased snaps and targets when Legette was sidelined, but it didn't add to much. He caught two of five targets for 37 yards. The Falcons have a middling pass defense, though, so perhaps Mingo will have a better chance."
Mack Hollins,Bills,WR,6,"In Weeks 4 and 5, Mack Hollins has amassed 12 total targets for the Bills, translating into just three catches for 32 yards, and he hasn't scored since Week 1. A Week 6 matchup against the Jets is more appealing if WR Khalil Shakir is again out because of an ankle injury. Hollins merits deep league flex consideration only if Shakir is unable to don the pads."
Pat Freiermuth,Steelers,TE,6,"Pat Freiermuth operates as the second receiver in Pittsburgh's offense behind George Pickens, earning at least four targets in all but one contest this season. Despite that opportunity, he's worked primarily in short areas of the field and has topped 40 receiving yards in a game just once. Freiermuth has managed to pad his fantasy output with touchdowns in each of the Steelers' last two games heading into a Week 6 matchup with the Raiders, which is enough to make him a low-end TE1 option given the state of the position."
Ja'Lynn Polk,Patriots,WR,6,"Ja'Lynn Polk appears to be trending upward for the Patriots entering Week 6. He played 100% of the Week 5 snaps and has drawn 13 targets across the past two weeks, but it's resulted in just four catches for 43 yards. There are whispers of a quarterback change, though it's unclear how that would affect Polk. Thus far, the Patriots' passing game has shown no signs of life, and a Week 6 matchup against a Texans defense that's allowing 173.4 passing yards per game isn't inspiring. Polk is a depth stash, not yet a consideration for your lineups."
Miles Sanders,Panthers,RB,6,"Miles Sanders hopes to tighten his grip on the backup running back job as the Panthers play the Falcons in Week 6. Sanders did little to stake his claim to the job last week, rushing twice for six yards and catching two of three targets for 27 yards. But the Panthers trailed most of the game, which impacted his workload. He needs a strong outing at some point if he's to hold off second-round pick Jonathan Brooks, who is close to returning from an ACL injury. The Falcons, though, are tough against the run, allowing the fourth-fewest fantasy points per game to running backs."
Brenton Strange,Jaguars,TE,6,"Brenton Strange is averaging 30.0 receiving yards over Jacksonville's last four games and has scored two TDs over that span. That production has come with Evan Engram (hamstring) sidelined, and if Engram -- who is listed as questionable -- returns in Week 6 against the Bears, Strange would likely sink back into fantasy irrelevance. Should Strange get another start, he would be a bye week streamer against a Bears defense that's limiting TEs to 32.4 yards per game."
Jahan Dotson,Eagles,WR,6,"Jahan Dotson attempted to operate as the No. 1 wideout for the Eagles before their bye, but failed to achieve much success. Dotson was targeted four times, but was only able to muster two catches for 11 yards in the dismal 33-16 loss to the Bucs. With the benefit of the bye, the hope is that both A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith will return from injury. Even if they do not, Dotson does not appear ready to contribute heavily. The Eagles will also be facing a stout Cleveland pass defense allowing just 184.4 passing yards per clash, which is eighth in the NFL."
Laviska Shenault Jr.,Seahawks,WR,6,"Laviska Shenault didn't receive any carries or targets last weekend. Shenault serves primarily as Seattle's kick returner, though he does occasionally see some usage in the offense as a gadget player. He only played five of 58 snaps in Week 5, and he doesn't receive enough playing time to be a fantasy relevant option. In Week 6, the Seahawks go up against San Francisco. The 49ers are allowing 197 passing yards per game in 2024, 12th best in the league."
Kalif Raymond,Lions,WR,6,"Kalif Raymond stands to contribute as a depth piece on offense as the Lions prepare for a Week 6 road matchup against Dallas. Tim Patrick has beaten out Raymond for the No. 3 receiver gig behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, as the two played 48 percent vs. 10 percent of offensive snaps Week 4. Raymond, instead, did most of his damage on special teams, contributing in the return game. He'll continue to field punts, and occasionally kickoffs, versus the Cowboys."
Xavier Gipson,Jets,WR,6,"Xavier Gipson failed to record a target in Week 5 for the third time this season, while the Jets threw a season-high 51 times. QB Aaron Rodgers notoriously leans on veterans, and with running backs Breece Hall and Braelon Allen, along with tight end Tyler Conklin factoring prevalently into the passing game, there aren't enough opportunities available for Gipson to provide a fantasy return. A Week 6 matchup against a Bills defense that's allowing 215.0 yards per game seems unlikely to change that narrative, leaving Gipson fantasy irrelevant."
Johnny Wilson,Eagles,WR,6,"Johnny Wilson attempted to fill in for injured teammates A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith before Philadelphia's bye, but the attempt was short-lived. Wilson left the 33-16 loss to the Bucs early and was evaluated for a concussion. He was targeted twice but did not have a catch for the game. Wilson's status is unknown for Week 6 versus the Browns. Even if Wilson can suit up, and Brown and Smith remain sidelined, Cleveland is allowing just 184.4 passing yards per contest, which is eighth in the league."
Cedrick Wilson Jr.,Saints,WR,6,"Cedrick Wilson wasn't targeted in Week 5, and it appears as if Mason Tipton has passed him on the Saints wide receiver depth chart. Wilson only played in 12 of 53 offensive snaps, and he has only been targeted once through the first five games for one catch for three yards. Without injuries to Chris Olave or Rashid Shaheed, Wilson doesn't get enough opportunities to be a fantasy option in the near term. In Week 6, the Saints go up against Tampa Bay, who have allowed 258 passing yards per game this season."
DeAndre Carter,Bears,WR,6,"DeAndre Carter will continue handling a depth role in Chicago's receiving corps as the team travels to London for a Week 6 matchup against the Jaguars. With all of DJ Moore, Rome Odunze and Keenan Allen healthy and on the field for the Bears, Carter was held without a catch in the team's 36-10 win over the Panthers. He did work in the return game, taking his one kickoff back for 30 yards, and handling one punt return for six yards. Carter will continue contributing as Chicago's No. 4 receiver in Week 6."
Mason Rudolph,Titans,QB,6,"Mason Rudolph threw for 85 yards in relief after Will Levis hurt his shoulder in the first quarter of Tennessee's Week 4 win over the Dolphins, but Levis will return to the starting role coming out of the Week 5 bye. Rudolph will thus be relegated to the bench, though Levis may be on a short leash after committing nine turnovers in a little more than three full games. If Rudolph enters in relief again, he could find success in Week 6 against a Colts defense that has allowed the fourth-most passing yards this season, but Rudolph's off the fantasy radar as long as Levis is Tennessee's starting QB."
Ronnie Bell,49ers,WR,6,"Ronnie Bell didn't receive any targets in Week 5, and he played in just 10 of 64 offensive snaps. It's possible that Bell will be the fourth receiver on San Francisco's depth chart, especially with Chris Conley being considered day-to-day with an oblique injury. Even if that's the case, Bell doesn't see enough playing time to be a reliable fantasy option in this offense. In Week 6, San Francisco goes up against Seattle, who have allowed 183 passing yards per game this season."
